## This is a MERN stack boiler plate project for using starter code for any MERN stack project

### How to setup this code

First of all

```
then go inside folder you can see `backend` folder and `frontend` folder

then inside backend folder make a file called `.env`

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 8000
CLIENT_URL = http://localhost:3000
DATABASE = 'YOUR DATABASE URL'
JWT_SECRET = 12345

```

then run backend

first you need to install whole package,

`npm install` or `npm i`

then

`npm start` (I have installed nodemon)

That's it for backend
